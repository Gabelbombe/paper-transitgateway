# Next-Generation Networking with AWS Transit Gateway

An announcement in AWS' networking space, the release of **AWS Transit Gateway** and the introduction of **Shared VPCs** has particularly caught my attention. AWS Transit Gateway is a truly game-changing technology solution as it provides a central hub for connecting AWS VPCs and VPN connections, while Shared VPC eases the pain of managing multiple VPCs by allowing you to centrally manage and distribute them to accounts in your organization.

Considering the array of cutting-edge services at your fingertips within the AWS platform, it's fairly easy to understand why a core topic such as network architecture often draws less of a crowd, or the ire of most.

But answer me this: Would you build a new house without first knowing that the foundations were solid?

While I am amazed by AWS and their continued product releases in areas such as IoT, real-time data streaming and now even Satellite communication, I remain passionate about fundamental content such as multi-account strategies, governance at scale, and network architectures in the cloud. As a cloud architect, these are the foundations that pave the way for success in our respective journeys with Amazons cloud ecosystem.

I'll start by discussing the historical challenges of networking at scale in AWS, before outlining each service and discussing how I believe their combination will alter the design of foundational network architectures in AWS going forward.
