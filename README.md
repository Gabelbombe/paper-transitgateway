# Next-Generation Networking with AWS Transit Gateway

An announcement in AWS' networking space, the release of AWS Transit Gateway and the introduction of Shared VPCs has particularly caught my attention. AWS Transit Gateway is a truly game-changing technology solution as it provides a central hub for connecting AWS VPCs and VPN connections, while Shared VPC eases the pain of managing multiple VPCs by allowing you to centrally manage and distribute them to accounts in your organization.
